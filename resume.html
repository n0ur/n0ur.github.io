            Nour is an extraordinary student who always goes beyond expectations. I had the opportunity to supervise her graduation project at JUST, she successfully completed a complex project that required the integration of many components. She got an excellent feedback from the committee who evaluate the project and considered among the top 5% of the students.

            I have known Nour on two levels, namely professionally and personally, for several years. On the professional level, where she worked on few projects for me, I found her to be hard-working, detail-oriented with an eye for the big picture, tenacious, creative and punctual. On the personal level, she is caring, conscientious and adventurous. Nour will be an asset to any team, with great capacity for valuable contributions.
